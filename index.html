                        <p class="article-text">Several studies have investigated the compounds present in blueberries, especially anthocyanins — pigments that give the fruit its characteristic color. Researchers have observed interesting results in the laboratory, although more human studies are needed for definitive conclusions.</p>
                        <p class="article-text">It is important to note that no single food can guarantee specific health benefits. A balanced and varied diet, combined with healthy lifestyle habits, remains the recommendation of experts.</p>

                        <p class="article-text">While research on blueberries and cognitive health is promising, it is essential to maintain realistic expectations. Nutrition science is complex, and the results of individual studies should be interpreted with caution.</p>
                        <p class="article-text">Always consult a healthcare professional before making significant changes to your diet, especially if you have specific health conditions or are taking medications.</p>
